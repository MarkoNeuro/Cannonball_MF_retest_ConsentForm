        <h1><strong>Study Information<strong></h1>
        <p style="font-size: 1.5em;"><strong>Study title:</strong> Assessing the Stability of Learning Behaviors with a Simple Interactive Game</p>
        <p><i><strong>Ethical Clearance Reference Number:</strong> MRSP-23/24-43869<i></p>

        <p>I would like to invite you to participate in this research project which forms part of my PhD research. Before you decide whether you want to take part, it is important for you to understand why the research is being done and what your participation will involve. Please take time to read the following information carefully and discuss it with others if you wish. Ask me if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more information.</p>

        <h2><strong>What is the purpose of the study?<strong></h2>
        <p>You are invited to participate in a research study aimed at understanding learning processes through a gamified task. In this experiment, you will be asked to choose between two options to maximize your points. The task is simple and interactive, designed to study how people learn and adapt to different outcomes.</p>

        <p>The experiment will be conducted in three sessions, spaced two weeks (14 days) apart. Your participation will involve completing the same task in all three sessions. Your responses will help us assess the consistency of learning behavior over time.</p>

        <h2><strong>Why have I been invited to take part?<strong></h2>
        <p>You are being invited to participate in this study because you are over 18 and live in the UK.<p>

        <h2><strong>What will happen if I take part?<strong></h2>
        <p>You will play a simple game that involves learning to make decisions that will maximize the number of points you gain. You will need to perform the task at three different sessions. You will need to do the second session at least 14 days after you complete the first one, and the third session 14 days after the second one. Each session will take around 10 minutes to complete. Each session will be scheduled as a separate experiment on Prolific. You will receive an invite for the subsequent sessions only if you have completed the previous one.<p>

        <h2><strong>Do I have to take part?<strong></h2>
        <p>Participation is completely voluntary. You should only take part if you want to and choosing not to take part will not disadvantage you in anyway. If you choose to take part you will be asked to provide your consent. To do this you will be asked to indicate that you have read and understand the information provided and that you consent to your anonymous data being used for the purposes explained. You are free to withdraw at any point during completion of the survey, without having to give a reason. If you wish for the responses you have provided to be deleted, you will be able to request this by sending the researcher a message through Prolific within 6 months of completing the study. Data linked with your Prolific ID will then be removed. Withdrawing from the study will not affect you in any way. Please do not include any personal identifiable information in your responses.</p>

        <h2><strong>Incentives<strong></h2>
        <p>You will be compensated for the time you take to complete this study at a rate of £9 per hour for the initial session, £10 for the second, and £11 for the third. You will be compensated separately for each session you complete.</p>

        <h2><strong>What are the possible risks of taking part?<strong></h2>
        <p>This study involves low risk, meaning there will be no more risk than in daily life.</p>

        <h2><strong>Data handling and confidentiality<strong></h2>
        <p>This research is anonymous. This means that nobody, including the researchers, will be aware of your identity, and that nobody will be able to connect you to the answers you provide, even indirectly. Your anonymous data will be stored initially in cloud storage services provided by Google, but we may share anonymized data in public research databases, to enable its use by other researchers in the future. This data will always be anonymous and it will not be possible for anyone to link the data to you.</p>

        <h2><strong>How is the project being funded?<strong></h2>
        <p>This study is being funded by a Career Development Award from the Wellcome Trust to Dr Toby Wise.</p>

        <h2><strong>What will happen to the results of the study?<strong></h2>
        <p>The results of the study will be summarized in publications, which will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. The data collected as part of this study my also be shared with other researchers through public research databases.</p>

        <h2><strong>Who should I contact for further information?<strong></h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or require more information about this study, please contact me on Prolific or at marko.1.dimitrovski@kcl.ac.uk</p>

        <h2><strong>What if I have further questions, or if something goes wrong?<strong></h2>
        <p>If this study has harmed you in any way or if you wish to make a complaint about the conduct of the study you can contact King's College London using the details below for further advice and information:</p>
